AutoProxy modernized, faster, and easier to use. 

[Install lastest version](https://github.com/Xenofex/autoproxy-plus/releases/download/v0.1.4/autoproxy_plus_0.1.4.xpi) from [this repository's releases](https://github.com/Xenofex/autoproxy-plus/releases). Mozilla's add-on review has been too slow for me. The first full review is still in the queue. So I provide this alternate way to install.

[Install](https://addons.mozilla.org/zh-CN/firefox/addon/autoproxy-plus/ "AutoProxy Plus") at Mozilla's add-on site.
